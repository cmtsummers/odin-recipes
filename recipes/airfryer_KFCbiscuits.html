   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>Buttery, soft, from scratch biscuits that taste like the ones from KFC, but are cooked in an air fryer. You could bake the biscuits in an oven, but this recipe assumes you have and want to cook the biscuits in an air fryer.</p>
   <h4>Ingredients</h4>
   <p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. Baking Powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp. Granulated Sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. Cream of Tartar</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. Salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Unsalted Butter (cold or frozen)</li>
        <li>2/3 cup Milk</li>
    </ul>
   </p>
   <h4>Steps</h4>
   <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the flour, baking powder, sugar, cream of tartar, and salt, mix well.</li>
        <li>Use a pastry blender to really work the butter into the dough. Then slowly pour in the milk. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Spread the batter onto a floured surface. Roll out the dough.</li>
        <li>Cut out your dough with a biscuit cutter. I used a 2 1/2 inch biscuit cutter. The size of the biscuits will affect cooking time.</li>
        <li>Place parchment paper into the air fryer basket and spray with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Place the biscuits onto the parchment paper. Set the temperature to 320 degrees F, air fryer setting for 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
