    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The hot mess best friend of desserts stars as the trashy dessert of our dreams.As the rainbow sprinkles bleed out into the whipped cream over time, the leftovers will look like a sad clown. Somehow this contributes to this dessert's appeal.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>8 Pop-Tarts (use a single flavor or mix and match as you please)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Powdered Sugar</li>
            <li>1 pint Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
            <li>1 tsp. Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>Sprinkles (for decorating)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop, break, rip, crumble (whatever floats your boat) the Pop-Tarts. Set them aside.</li>
            <li>Add 1/4 cup of powdered sugar and the pint of heavy whipping cream in a mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Whip with a stand or hand mixer until you get medium peaks, then stir in the teaspoon of vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Add a quarter of the whipped cream to cover the bottom of a bowl. Preferably a flat bottomed, clear glass bowl.</li>
            <li>Add an even layer of hunks of broken Pop-Tarts.</li>
            <li>Continue making even layers of whipped cream and broken Pop-Tart until you run out of both. Make sure and run out of whipped cream last, so that the top layer is whipped cream.</li>
            <li>Cover the trifle and put it in the fridge for at least 4 hours, or overnight. This allows the moisture in the whipped cream to soften the Pop-Tarts and for the cream to firm up, becoming more similar in texture.</li>
            <li>Right before serving, decorate it with sprinkles to maximize the whimsy.</li>
        </ol>
